  <ul>
    <li>
    <a href="#"><h3>Why is the price an approximation? How will I know the final price for my map?</h3></a>
    <p>Since data sets are formatted differently we first have to analyze if the data need to be cleaned or not, or if we will have to do more than expected data manipulation to render it properly on a map. As such we can only offer an approximation at the beginning.</p>
